# Rust Star host-runtime scaffold

This crate is the smallest executable boundary for the new engine. It is
model-specific by design and currently contains no Metal kernels.

Implemented contracts:

- bounded, dependency-free GGUF v3 metadata/tensor-directory parsing;
- no tensor-payload reads during inspection;
- duplicate, overflow, alignment, overlap, UTF-8, type, and file-bound checks;
- exact DeepSeek V4 Flash shape validation derived from DwarfStar;
- exact resident imatrix-Q2 tensor recipe validation: IQ2_XXS routed gate/up,
  Q2_K routed down, Q8_0 attention/shared/output, and F16 HC/compressor/indexer;
- a full-FP32-logit JSON writer compatible with `../ARTIFACT_FORMAT.md`.

The validator proves model shape and quantization-recipe identity. It does not
pretend that a mutable GGUF name proves the `0731` checkpoint. The completed
`oracle-v1` manifest's whole-file model SHA-256 will be authoritative.

## Build and test

Rust 1.74 or newer is required. No crates are downloaded.

```sh
cargo fmt --manifest-path rust-star/runtime/Cargo.toml --check
cargo test --manifest-path rust-star/runtime/Cargo.toml
cargo build --release --manifest-path rust-star/runtime/Cargo.toml
```

`check_runtime.sh` additionally writes a synthetic candidate artifact with the
Rust writer and makes the existing Python comparator accept it as C0 against
itself. This catches cross-language JSON/FP32 contract mistakes.

On the target Mac, run all host checks and inspect the real model with:

```sh
./rust-star/check_runtime.sh \
  /absolute/path/to/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731-Q2-imatrix.gguf
```

Inspection reads the header, metadata, and tensor directory. It seeks over
large tokenizer arrays and does not hash or read tensor payloads, so this check
is not a substitute for `capture_oracle_v1.py`'s whole-model hash.

For a structural diagnosis that intentionally skips target identity:

```sh
rust-star/.work/runtime-target/release/rust-star gguf MODEL.gguf
```

Do not use the structural-only result as evidence that an inference model is
supported.
